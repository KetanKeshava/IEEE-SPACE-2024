                                    Affordable and high performance front end modules (FEMs) have been identified as key research challenges for millimeter wave communications. While the design of active components and sub-systems has been explored by many research groups, there is still a need to provide integration and packaging strategies that can meet system requirements and not inhibit the performance obtained at the wafer level. This poses challenges on the front-end modules (FEM) to deliver innovative packaging solutions which can fulfill the FEM integration requirements to maximize performance. Antenna in package (AiP) is a key technique that will enable the realization of 6G FEMs. The talk will discuss AiP solutions from a multi-disciplinary research team from University of Texas at Dallas. The talk will highlight the design, modeling, and characterization of planar antennas integrated into enhanced quad flat no-lead (eQFN) packages in WR8 (90GHz-140GHz) and WR5 (140GHz-220GHz) frequency bands. Further, the design, modeling, and simulation results of chip-to-package transitions, transmission line structures, and antenna feed elements are discussed. The simulated bandwidth and gain of the integrated antennas is compared with their standalone versions. To facilitate accurate design of the antennas and packaging transitions, high frequency material characterization is needed. This work will include results on the dielectric properties of the packaging substrates and over mold materials utilized in the frequency ranges mentioned. A workflow to characterize fatigue failure under board level vibration will be introduced. Simulation results indicating the potential locations of the solder failure under vibration will also be presented. Validation of simulation results is conducted using fringe projection to directly measure the vibration mode when a printed circuit board (PCB) is under vibration.

                                “Metasurface” (MTS) denotes a surface constituted at microwave frequency by PCB or 3D printed elements small in terms of wavelengths that collectively exhibits equivalent homogeneous boundary conditions to any interacting electromagnetic fields. MTSs have had and are having a strong impact in Antenna applications. In the years 2000-2010 MTS for antennas were essentially uniform in space and realized by periodic printed elements. This was the first generation of MTS. In the second generation (2010-2020), MTS for antennas was constructed in such a way to change boundary conditions in space and control the scattered field. Today we are facing a transition to the third generation of MTS antennas, where MTSs change boundary conditions in space and time, opening new perspectives in 5G communications and beyond. In this presentation, the evolution of MTS antennas is described, with new ideas and examples. Emphasis will be given on the use of reflective intelligent surfaces (RIS) for beyond 5G communications.

                                Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AEW&C) system is a system of systems with Integrated systems that work in synchronization with each other to provide a true force multiplier early warning capability. However, there are major challenges. These challenges become multi-fold in the case of integration of multiple RF systems onboard an aircraft with limited space, volume and power. The operational frequencies of the systems onboard an AEW&C system typically spreads from few MHz to tens of GHz. Effective realization and utilization of AEW&C in an operational environment requires integration of large number of antennas and external sensors. The mounting of antennae in a restricted space should not only provide good Field-of-View (FoV) but with minimal interferences between the systems. Measures are taken through spatial, temporal and spectral diversity to mitigate the challenges. The effect of aircraft structure on the antenna pattern and its impact on the performance of the system is another challenge to be addressed during the design and development of large scale complex airborne surveillance systems such as an Airborne Early Warning and Control system. Use of Computational Electromagnetic (CEM) analysis techniques to optimize the location for positioning the antennas on the aircraft fuselage provides a viable and practical solution to the problem.The design of LRUs to meet the EMI/EMC, Environmental Qualification standards are additional challenges faced by any airborne system designer. Further, the design of long-range medium-PRF airborne pulse-doppler radar with low sidelobes is itself very challenging along with the operation of SIGINT systems. In this address, the aspect of challenges in the Design, Development and Integration of an Indigenous Airborne Early Warning and Control System is described along with the practical solutions evolved to realize, flight test and induct the system into the Services.

                                <br>The demonstration of how to transmit and receive radio waves, first done by Sir J.C. Bose in 1894, led to the opening up of a new window to the Universe. Radio astronomy involves tight interaction with many fields of engineering, especially those relevant to MAPCON! India has a strong tradition in this branch of astronomy, starting with Prof Govind Swarup who kicked off activities in this area at TIFR in 1963. In this talk, we will trace the fascinating story of radio astronomy and the engineering behind it, with special emphasis on its growth and current status in India, ending with the frontline Indian facility -- the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). The GMRT, a world class low frequency radio observatory operational since 2002, consists of 30 fully steerable antennas of 45 metre diameter each and can be used as an aperture-synthesis array for imaging, as well as a phased array to study compact radio sources such as pulsars. It uses several interesting and innovative ideas and technologies. We have recently completed a major upgrade of the GMRT that has improved its sensitivity by a factor of three and has also made it a much more versatile instrument. This upgrade, which employs some cutting edge new technologies, will keep the GMRT at the forefront as one of the most sensitive facility in the 100 to 1500 MHz range for the next decade or so. This talk will spotlight some of these multi-disciplinary technological aspects of the GMRT, and also take a look into how it has improved our understanding of the Universe, and what the future holds.

                                Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a common method for quantum calculations that offers a good balance between accuracy and computational cost. An important challenge in both
                                ground state and excited state DFT is the calculation of electrostatic and electrodynamic induced potentials, as well as the Fock exchange interaction. For the ground state, we present an accurate scalar Green’s function kernels to efficiently evaluate the Hartree and Fock potentials using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method to solve the Poisson equation. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method, using hybrid and screened hybrid DFT, to study the properties of silicon quantum dots comprising over a thousand atoms (3 nm diameter). In the excited state, electrodynamic fields are formally incorporated within time dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) by considering both induced scalar and vector potentials. The Hamiltonian is described in both the Coulomb and Lorenz gauges, and the advantages of the latter are outlined. Integral expressions are defined for the retarded potentials of each gauge and a methodological approach to evaluating these nontrivial expressions with a low computational cost is adopted. The faster potential calculations enables the study of larger systems, such as nanoscale antennas.

                                <br>Future communication links (future 5G) will require higher data rates, multiple beams, and higher transmit/receive gains, in addition to smaller weight, cost, and power. With the growing interest for reduced size platforms and the requirement for ultra-wideband (UWB) performance to address multi-functionality, there is a strong need for UWB RF front-ends with ultra flexible interfaces. The latter will include millimeter wave and THz capabilities to enable increased spectral efficiency, multi-functionality and security. Simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR) transceivers are also becoming a focus for the coming decade.   Further, in recent years, a variety of flexible fabric-based electronics have been proposed. To this end, our team proposed a new class of conductive textiles that have demonstrated unique capabilities in terms of flexibility, durability and manufacturing-ease using standard automated embroidery machinery. These electronic threads (E-threads) have the capability to generate fully embroidered microwave circuitry that has the same electrical properties as traditional microwave circuits printed on PCBs. As such, a new class of wearable devices that are fully integrated and inconspicuously placed within clothing is possible. This presentation will focus on innovative methods for handling UWB communications with RF front end and back-end capabilities having historically low power and game-changing frequency-independent operation. They will include low power MIMO and beamforming across large bandwidths, from MHz to millimeter wave bands. Challenges in realizing future textile-based electronic devices, including wearable wideband transceivers will be presented. Among them, reliable wearable interconnects, chipsets that are less bulky and integrated with the textile circuitry, and manufacturing challenges will be discussed.

                                The Microwave/millimetre-wave technology had taken strong root in the country in 1895, when JC Bose pioneered the mm-wave wireless technology in India. Ever since, there has been a widespread activity in this field and a robust eco-system comprising of several academic institutes, R&D laboratories, test & measurement facilities, public and private industries has been established in India. This has enabled the country to achieve considerable success in theoretical research, indigenous design, development of various microwave/mm-wave systems, sub-systems and components. Some of the sub-areas wherein substantial achievements have been made include: antennas, coaxial and waveguide passive components, GaAs active devices, MIC and MMIC modules, RF-MEMS, high power vacuum electronic devices, solid-state devices, TR-modules, microwave power modules, systems for civilian and defence communications, satellite communications, deep-space communications; high resolution space-borne imaging sensors, radiometers, scatterometers, altimeters, weather radars, defence radars, missile guidance and electronic warfare systems; microwave driven particle accelerators, intense x-ray sources for hyperthermia, radiography and cargo scanners; microwave heating for drying and disinfection of food, material processing, and area-sanitization; mm-wave plasma diagnostic and microwave/ mm-wave plasma heating for fusion reactors (ITER & IPR-Tokamak) etc. Besides this, several initiatives have also been taken in the THz-wave domain, such as, THz astronomical telescope, imaging system and short range high data rate communication system etc.  However, despite our successes in indigenous development of several complex component, device and system technologies, the translation of technology to market has been rather limited. Moreover, the manufacturing base for special materials, components and devices is almost non-existent with us, leading the local industry to be largely dependent on imports. It is also difficult to find enough industry-ready engineers in-spite of a huge number of electronics engineers graduating every year. Thus, there is a need to take a holistic view of the microwave-terahertz-wave technology domain, which is so crucial for national development.  It is in this context that, the Indian National Academy of Engineering has set up an expert group on, “Advanced Microwave-THz-wave technology & Applications- Way ahead for India” _to evolve a position paper to serve as a reference document for various stake holders and policy makers. The group is involved in making a thorough assessment of the technology status and market scenario in short- and long- term, identify the facilitating factors for growth of indigenous technology and industry in this strategic area and propose intervention measures.  In this talk, a brief perspective on the MW-THz-wave Technology and Applications in the Indian context will be presented on behalf of the expert group, with a view to connect with the stake holders and the experts to gather further inputs on the subject.

Some of the sub-areas wherein substantial achievements have been made include: antennas, coaxial and waveguide passive components, GaAs active devices, MIC and MMIC modules, RF-MEMS, high power vacuum electronic devices, solid-state devices, TR-modules, microwave power modules, systems for civilian and defence communications, satellite communications, deep-space communications; high resolution space-borne imaging sensors, radiometers, scatterometers, altimeters, weather radars, defence radars, missile guidance and electronic warfare systems; microwave driven particle accelerators, intense x-ray sources for hyperthermia, radiography and cargo scanners; microwave heating for drying and disinfection of food, material processing, and area-sanitization; mm-wave plasma diagnostic and microwave/ mm-wave plasma heating for fusion reactors (ITER & IPR-Tokamak) etc. Besides this, several initiatives have also been taken in the THz-wave domain, such as, THz astronomical telescope, imaging system and short range high data rate communication system etc.  However, despite our successes in indigenous development of several complex component, device and system technologies, the translation of technology to market has been rather limited. Moreover, the manufacturing base for special materials, components and devices is almost non-existent with us, leading the local industry to be largely dependent on imports. It is also difficult to find enough industry-ready engineers in-spite of a huge number of electronics engineers graduating every year. Thus, there is a need to take a holistic view of the microwave-terahertz-wave technology domain, which is so crucial for national development.  It is in this context that, the Indian National Academy of Engineering has set up an expert group on, “Advanced Microwave-THz-wave technology & Applications- Way ahead for India” _to evolve a position paper to serve as a reference document for various stake holders and policy makers. The group is involved in making a thorough assessment of the technology status and market scenario in short- and long- term, identify the facilitating factors for growth of indigenous technology and industry in this strategic area and propose intervention measures.  In this talk, a brief perspective on the MW-THz-wave Technology and Applications in the Indian context will be presented on behalf of the expert group, with a view to connect with the stake holders and the experts to gather further inputs on the subject.

                            Advancement in industry automation, bio-imaging, bio-sensing, military applications have generated research interest in mmW and THz technology. Development of mmW/THz solid-
state source with appreciable power is attracting attention of researchers due to their important applications in short range terrestrial and airborne communication including space-based communication. Some of the THz sources reported in the literature are electron beam, optically pumped far-infrared gas lasers, semiconductor QCLs, resonant tunneling diode, IMPATT diode and Gunn diode. Cascaded frequency multipliers are also in use for high frequency generation. These solid-state sources can be tuned to appropriate THz frequency. IMPATT devices based on Si are reported to provide high power at different frequencies in mm-wave window. But the power generated by these sources at THz is not sufficient for intended applications. The researchers are therefore exploring solid-state sources at THz frequency band which should be compact, cost-effective, efficient and powerful. In this respect, the potentiality of IMPATT devices based on WBG semiconducting materials such as SiC, GaN and type-IIb diamond as high-power sources has been reported at THz frequencies.

                                Global demand for energy has grown rapidly in recent years. To meet the long-term demand of global energy, different techniques of wireless energy harvesting were introduced. Harvesting RF energy is an alternative solution, especially with the advances and popularity of wireless communication devices. These communication devices are constantly transmitting RF energy, so RF energy harvesting paves a way to utilize the abundant scattered electromagnetic (EM) waves in our surroundings environment. The available EM waves (RF energy) can be in any polarizations, such as elliptical, linear, or circular. By using an appropriate receiving antenna, EM waves can be converted into electrical energy for low-powered devices, and thus, there is much focus put toward RF energy-harvesting (RFEH) systems, especially in the antenna designs. A CP antenna enables the system to harvest RF energy regardless of the device orientation as well as making the insensitive to polarization loss. The RF waves/energy that is found in the surrounding area can exist in any orientation and phase alignment, so CP antennas are more desirable for energy harvesting systems. A dual-feed structure provides a wider 3-dB AR bandwidth compared to the single-feed CP antenna, but it involves a bulky feeding system with a ground plane. For a single-feed CP antenna with compact size, the slight perturbing of the radiator structure for the single-feed configuration is required to excite two modes with a phase shift of 90°. There are different perturbation methods for a square patch radiator, such as truncated corners, slits, slots, and stubs, to generate CP radiation. This invited talk presents an overview on the antenna design considerations for RFEH systems and describes updates recent progress in the antenna technologies for RFEH. Compact and low-profile CP antenna designs will be also presented in detail for RFEH applications.

                                The talk will outline a novel strategy for uncooled, tunable, multispectral infrared detection. Due to the low photon energy, detection of infrared photons is challenging at room temperature. One atom thick graphene offers an alternative mechanism bypassing material bandgap restriction. Further, the ability of carrier concentration modulation on graphene via external voltage offers dynamic spectral selectivity for “color” night vision/sensing. The performance of preliminary demonstration compares favorably even with present cryogenically cooled detection schemes paving the path for commercial development of many applications from space exploration to healthcare.

                                Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a low-cost wireless technology, enabling to engage, identify, locate, transact, and authenticate products. RFID market has identified as a growing market of enormous potential over the past few years. It is worth observing that most of RFID applications in logistics and other areas can successfully develop in the market only if the cost of RFID tags drops to a very low price. Standard RFID tags do contain chipsets, which need to get the power required for their activation from the reader, through a wireless power transfer procedure.  In this context, chipless RFIDs represent an alternative approach for identifying objects, authenticating and sensing. The basic idea is to simplify the tag by removing any active circuit from it. Indeed, even if the cost of chipped RFID tags is already low (about 10 eurocents when distributed in large quantities), the removal of the microchip could make radio frequency labels available at a sub-cent cost. In this respect, it is important to consider that chipless tags fabrication is fully compatible with printed electronics low-cost manufacturing methods such as, for instance, screen printing, gravure, offset lithography, and inkjet printing. Another important advantage of chipless tags is to open the way of application of radio frequency labeling in extreme environments, where electronics may not be used. Some application examples of chipless RFID technology will be shown at the conference to the end of demonstrating its potentiality.

                                Giuliano Manara received the Laurea (Doctor) degree in electronic engineering (summa cum laude) from the University of Florence, Italy, in 1979. He was first with the School of Engineering of the University of Florence, Italy. Then, in 1987 he moved to the University of Pisa, Italy, where he is presently a Professor of Electromagnetics and Microwave Techniques at the Department of Information Engineering of the School of Engineering. Since 1980, he has been collaborating with the Department of Electrical Engineering of the Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, where, in the summer and fall of 1987, he was involved in research at the ElectroScience Laboratory. His research interests have centered mainly on the asymptotic solution of radiation and scattering problems to improve and extend the uniform geometrical theory of diffraction (UTD). In this framework, he has analyzed electromagnetic wave scattering from material bodies, with emphasis on the scattering from both isotropic and anisotropic impedance wedges. He has also been engaged in research on numerical, analytical and hybrid techniques (in both frequency and time domain), scattering from rough surfaces, frequency selective surfaces (FSS), and electromagnetic compatibility. His research has also been focused on microwave antennas with application to broadband wireless networks and on the development and testing of new microwave materials (metamaterials) for electronic systems. More recently, he has conducted research on electromagnetic issues enabling the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), with specific attention to antennas for near-field applications and the analysis (theoretical and experimental) of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems. Prof. Manara has authored more than 160 papers on qualified technical journals with referees, and more than 250 papers presented at international conferences. He was elected an IEEE Fellow in 2004 for “contributions to the uniform geometrical theory of diffraction and its applications.” From August 2011 to August 2014, he served as the International Chair of URSI (International Union of Radio Science) Commission B – Fields and Waves. In this context, he was the General Chair of the URSI Commission B International Electromagnetic Theory Symposium (EMTS), held in Hiroshima, Japan, during May 2013. In 2017, he was elected an URSI Fellow. Since August 2021, he has been serving as an URSI Vice-President.
