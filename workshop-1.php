        <h1>Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Technology</h1>
        <p class="speaker-info"><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Tapan Misra, DS & Former Director, SAC, Founding Director & Chief Scientist, SISIR Radar</p>
        <p class="time-venue"><strong>Time:</strong> 8.30-10.30 Hrs &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Venue:</strong> Amaryllis & Petunia</p>
        <h3>Abstract:</h3>
        <p>In the last seven decades, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) developed into a formidable tool for imaging earth, planetary objects and recently even imaging Event Horizon of black holes. Unlike optical imaging systems, SAR picks up structural signatures from interaction of different polarisations of electromagnetic waves to structural features. SAR signature is invariant to day and night, diurnal and seasonal variations. Further, the signature is almost unaffected by clouds, dusts, water vapours and other vagaries of weather, making SAR a prized imaging sensor. Consistency of SAR images, unlike optical imaging, makes it very much amenable to AI/ML. But SAR sensor itself is a bunch of contradictions. SAR is nothing but a pulse Doppler radar in motion. Because of motion, SAR signatures can be used to create a virtual array antenna of a very very large length and hence very fine beamwidth on a computer post facto. Hence the nomenclature of SAR. But SAR utilises clutter signal to create an image. But clutter is anathema to Radar engineers and an array of Radar literature is devoted to different techniques to eliminate clutter!! Similarly antenna engineers are accustomed to only array antennas operating in the far field of the Array antenna itself. However, the SAR antenna actually operates mostly in the reactive field region and rarely even in Near Field region of the Synthetic Array antenna itself. SAR array poses a significant contradiction to conventional knowledge of antenna operation. SAR antenna is formed post facto on computer. Surprisingly, the tool used for array synthesis of SAR is signal processing. The formidable signal processing requirements call for huge computing resources and clever software strategies to handle extremely large computation and back and forth exchange of large data multiple times. Further, over last five decades, computing hardware and computing architectures have evolved beyond imaginations. Consequently, SAR processing algorithms and software had to adapt repeatedly to match evolution of computing and storage systems. We all know that final geometric accuracies of optical images depend upon errors in three degrees of angular rotation and three degrees of positional estimates. Surprisingly, location accuracy of SAR images is governed by only errors in positon estimates but not at all on errors of angular estimates. In fact most SAR processors do not even use any data from angle sensors of SAR platform!! Superiority of SAR images accuracy makes it a "must have" sensor in every advanced fighter aircraft and reconnaissance platform. No doubt, SAR is a fascinating sensor and it is still evolving. This particular workshop talk will address various facets of SAR technology, their evolution and also signatures and applications of SAR imaging.</p>

        <h1>Create Physics-based High-Fidelity Space Mission Using Simulation</h1>
        <p class="speaker-info"><strong>Speakers:</strong> Mr. Nijas Kunju & Mr. Ravindra Challa, Ansys</p>
        <p class="time-venue"><strong>Time:</strong> 11.00-13.00 Hrs &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Venue:</strong> Amaryllis & Petunia</p>
        <h3>Abstract:</h3>
        <p>Space is always filled with mystery, and everyone is excited to hear about space exploration. Since there are many unknowns in space, the current achievements in space technologies are gathered from knowledge collected over the years by different countries. Unlike other areas, space organizations cannot afford failures in their missions, and first-time success is a major milestone. This workshop session will help the audience learn about the different stages of space missions and how simulation tools can help the space community model the entire mission virtually before creating a prototype. The agenda for the sessions is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a space mission from the requirements (spacecraft launch, orbit determination, satellite orbital maneuvering).</li>
            <li>Protect satellites from harsh space environments.</li>
            <li>Check the performance of space communication, radar, and EOIR systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="abstract">
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In today’s world, there is no discipline, where the word ‘Quality’ does not find a mention. Research, Design, Development, Production, Marketing, Service, Customer interaction etc are now more driven by quality concepts - than in yesteryears. While this focus on quality is relatively new to the commercial establishments, which are primarily driven by competition and globalisation, there are some disciplines of engineering/research like Defence and Aerospace Sectors, which due to their critical nature, had ingredients of quality and reliability built into their programmes, almost from inception. This talk gives a brief insight into various elements of R&QA, which need to be implemented for a spacecraft project. Technical drivers for quality programme of a spacecraft due to its unattended operation for long life duration under harsh environment of space are enumerated in the talk. Design assurance methodologies, Reliability Analyses like Derating analysis, Failure mode effects and criticality analysis (FMECA), Fault tree analysis (FTA) Worst case analysis, Sneak Circuit analysis, Reliability prediction, apportionment & demonstration, Test & Evaluation, Reviews etc are covered in addition to conventional Quality Control activities like Parts/Materials/ Process control and non-conformance control. The experiences gained at ISRO Satellite Centre, in realization of its highly successful Spacecraft Systems will be shared during the presentation. Various experiences / anecdotes of the presenter are embedded into the talk with a humorous touch to make the topic interesting and absorbing. Emerging concepts like First time right, Zero Defect Programme, Total Quality management (TQM) and Company wide quality control (CWQC) are also addressed. Though delivered with the background of space systems, the concepts are applicable to all fields of engineering, and gives the audience a bird’s eye view of activities to be accomplished for achieving customer satisfaction.</p>
